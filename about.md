## About Me 

I am currently a M.D./Ph.D student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Department of Bioengineering. My research focuses on cell signaling pathways important in new blood vessel formation-how these function normally, how they mis-function in various diseases, and how we could manipulate these processes to treat these disorders.
